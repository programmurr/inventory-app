# Inventory App

*Let's flex our skills a little! For this project you are going to make an Inventory management app for an imaginary store. Your app should have categories and items, so when the user goes to the home-page they can choose a category to view, and then get a list of every item in that category. You should include all of the CRUD methods for both items and categories, so anybody thatâ€™s visiting the site can Create, Read, Update or Delete any Item or Category.*

## Core Technologies

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)
- [Heroku](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)

## Learning Outcomes

- Implementation of CRUD with the MVC pattern
- Use of a NoSQL Database for storage
- Separation of Development and Production environments
- Deployment to Heroku

## Status

In progress. View my code here until it is ready for deployment.
